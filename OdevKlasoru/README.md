Project: Personal Software Developer Portfolio

1. Theme
The theme of this website is the personal portfolio of a Computer Engineering student. On the site, I introduce myself, showcase the projects I have developed so far, and list the technical services I offer (web development, coding, etc.). The aim is to present my skills to potential employers or clients using a simple HTML structure.

 2. File Organisation 
I organised the project files as follows:

- **index.html:** Home page. Contains the navigation menu, featured blog posts, and a general introduction.
- **about.html:** About me page. My personal details, educational background, hobbies, and detailed CV are on this page.
- **services.html:** Services page. Contains a table showing the services I offer and pricing.
- **contact.html:** Contact page. Contains the form necessary for visitors to reach me.
- **assets/**: All images (profile photo, project images, logo and icons) are collected in this folder.
  - assets/profile.jpg
  - assets/project1.jpg
  - assets/project2.jpg
  

 3. Challenges Encountered 
The biggest challenge in completing this assignment was using only ‘Semantic HTML5’ without CSS or JavaScript.
- **Visual Layout:** Without CSS, it was impossible to place elements side by side or centre them, so the page flow ended up being entirely in blocks from top to bottom.
- **Tables:** I had to use HTML's `border` attribute to make table borders visible.
- **Form Alignment:** Properly aligning labels and input fields in the contact form was very difficult without CSS, so I tried to achieve the layout by adding line breaks using `<p>` tags.

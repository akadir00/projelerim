For this assignment, I created three files: index.html for the structure, and two separate CSS files (styleA.css and styleB.css) to control the layouts. In the first style, I used Flexbox to stack the boxes vertically and ensure the spacing between them adjusts automatically when the window is resized. For the second style, I lined up the first five boxes horizontally and used fixed positioning to lock the last box to the bottom-right corner. The main challenge I faced was figuring out how to keep the vertical spacing equal in Style A without stretching the boxes, but using justify-content: space-between with a fixed container height solved it. I also made sure to use box-sizing so the borders didn't mess up the dimensions in Style B.
